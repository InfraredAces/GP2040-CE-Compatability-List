## Playstation 4

With the addition of the PS4 Mode and PS4 Authentication Add-On in GP2040-CE v0.7.1, all PS4 games are now compatible with GP2040-CE controllers in PS4 mode. However, unless authentications files are provided, the controller may be subject to an 8 minute timeout.

As of GP2040-CE v0.7.4, USB Passthrough Authentication is also available to have PS4 compatibility provided that the valid PS4 device is used. This disqualifies unauthorised PS4 controllers that have the 8 minute timeout and auto-restart as a work around.

# Playstation 5

This list is only considering PS5 versions of games on PS5 as PS4 mode should work on all PS4 versions of a game on PS5.
